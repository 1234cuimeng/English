# <center> A Melon for All Seasons

<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px;">
Despite its name, the winter melon is a melon that can be enjoyed <strong>all year round</strong>.It is also known as wax melon, ash gourd or white gourd mainly because its dark green skin develops a white waxy layer upon maturity.

It is a hardy vine plant that enjoys warm weather and is planted in spring so the vine can produce fruit that matures in summer and autumn.Shoots and tendrils are also edible, although the melons are the main crops.

Because of its thick waxy protective layer, the winter melon keeps well and is often stored as a winter vegetable long after it is harvested.

The fruits are huge and can grow to about 80 centimeters in length and about 20 cm in diameter, <strong>weighing up</strong> to 10 kilograms.These large fruits are <strong>cut into</strong> chunks and sold as more manageable wedges at Chinese markets.

<strong>In recent years</strong>, smaller varieties have been cultivated and these are still around 1 kg each.The melons are often cooked whole and then scooped out as a container for an assortment of ingredients such as Chinese ham, diced mushrooms, asparagus, fresh corn, prawns and dried scallops among others.

This is the classic banquet dish, known as winter melon broth.

Chefs used to take the larger melons, carefully sculpting the outer skin into intricate designs of white on green.The melon would then be steamed with the cap on and unveiled at the table for a dramatic centerpiece.

These days, modern Chinese chefs <strong>prefer to</strong> serve individual portions using the miniature melons.

Western kitchens often dismiss the winter melon as watery and tasteless, yet it is precisely these qualities that make it a favorite in the Chinese kitchen.The winter melon's subtlety is appreciated here, and it is often the canvas for richer ingredients because it sponges up the flavors of anything it is cooked with.

When it is prepared with any meat in a soup, the winter melon <strong>soaks up</strong> the flavors, adding its own clean green accent to the broth that is not unpleasant
