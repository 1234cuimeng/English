# <center> What To Do When You Forget Someone's Name

<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px;">
We've all been there: Upon walking into the office, an acquaintance cheerfully greets you by name and you pause, frantically searching your brain for theirs.

You don't want to disrespect them by saying the wrong name, but just saying "hey" seems so generic.Do you come clean about your memory lapse?

Here's how experts say you can address the conundrum strategically and still keep your relationships intact.

You may consider a subtle approach first.

If you are at an event and you see someone you knowbut you can't remember their name, introduce yourself first, because it often prompts that person to say their name too.That's what Mary Abbajay, president of the leadership development consultancy Careerstone Group, recommends.

"That is a signal for you to say your name back," Abbajay said.But don't think you are being sly about your strategy.Many people will recognize that it means you don't know their name, she said.

One other indirect approach is to discreetly ask someone else to tell you the other person's name, Abbajay added.

Better yet, ask them directly and apologize.

Avoiding saying someone's name every time you see them will only get you so far.

"I think people fake it too long, and then they meet that person three or four times, and then they are too embarrassed to ask their name," Abbajay said."The best thing is to nip that in the bud <strong>right away</strong>.The second time you meet them, say, <strong>'Remind</strong> me <strong>of</strong> your name again.Thank you <strong>so much</strong>.'"

Don't minimize your actions and say, "Oh I do this <strong>all the time</strong>."If this is your third or fourth time asking their name, that deserves a bigger <strong>mea culpa</strong>, Abbajay said.People's names are important to them, and you want your apology to <strong>come across</strong> as sincere.

Don't make it too big a deal, though, either.

<strong>Write down</strong> names whenever possible and try saying a person's name when you first meet them.

Brown said that writing down someone's name is what works best for her <strong>as far as</strong> remembering them.

Research has shown that <strong>writing</strong> things <strong>down</strong> helps our brains really retain what is being said.A 2014 study in Psychological Science, for example, found that students who <strong>wrote</strong> notes <strong>down</strong> on paper had better comprehension and retention of what was being taught than students typing on their laptops.

If you don't have access to a pen or paper, try using your voice.Here's a pro tip: Use someone's name within the first minutes of meeting someone.
