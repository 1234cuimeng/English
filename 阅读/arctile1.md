# <center> Millionaire Mindset Trick That Will Help You Hit Goals in 2024 

<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px;">
2023 is over, so many may already be <strong>mapping out</strong> and planning their 2024.


But if you're wondering how to really <strong>make the most of </strong>the coming year, then this woman might have the answer for you.

Content strategist Breana has gone viral online after explaining how to get into a 'millionaire mindset' in the New Year, and she claims this method will help you 'stay focused' and complete your goals.

She claims you start by <strong>writing down</strong> the different lifestyle categories you want to <strong>improve on</strong>, such as your personal relationships, finances, or your mental/physical health.Then for each of these you add a goal and why you want to achieve this.

'A lot of successful people look at quarters of the year as an entire year, so you don't get 365 days to complete something, you only get 90 days.

'Thinking this way prevents you from <strong>resting on</strong> your laurels because 90 days is a quarter of the time you would think you'd have, so you'd be more likely to stay focused on your goal day-to-day.'

Breana then advises making a chart, breaking the year up into four quarters and <strong>dividing up</strong> your goals between each quarter.

'So you're going to do that for all of your big topics, you're going to work your way back so for the next 90 days you only have to <strong>focus on</strong> six small tasks, but at the end of the actual year, you'll have completed so much more.'

She adds: 'This is where you lock it in, this is for the people who are literally going to change their lives next year.You need to provide yourself with some type of visual gratification.Doing a task without any gratification reduces your chance of doing the task.

The video has proved a hit with social media users, garnering one million likes and thousands of comments, with many praising Breana for sharing the advice.

Others joked that they simply couldn't be that organised, as @kristiankitten95 proclaimed: 'I'm trying to live 24 hours at a time lol.'

<strong>Either way</strong>, Catherine Drysdale, a relationship coach, claimed there was one thing everyone should take away from Breana's video when planning their New Year's resolutions and goals.

She said: 'Not knowing the WHY behind each goal is why so many people fail at New Year's resolutions.

'It helps your subconscious get on board so it's easier to stay committed to your goals.If your subconscious doesn't believe the why, it doesn't happen.'
